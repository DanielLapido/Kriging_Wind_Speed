# Wind prediction based on aircraft data using Kriging

The goal of this project is to explore the applicability of a geostatistical
technique called Kriging for short term wind speed prediction. The predictions are based on spatio-temporal correlation among wind observations
collected by aircraft acting as meteorological sensors. The objective is to
employ data from the last 3 minutes and provide reliable predictions for the
next minutes.
